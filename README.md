# Simple BDD

Simple BDD is a very simple BDD style test runner. It features only the bare essentials necessities for running BDD style tests.

Simple BDD is not designed to be run in production environments. Instead Simple BDD is primarily designed to be used for online
programming interviews, where the online editor has only limited JS support and doesn't provide any built in test library.

### Usage

You can simply copy-and-paste `index.min.js` at the top of any code editor and then write your tests below. Simple!
